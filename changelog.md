# audit-age changelog

## 0.1.1

- Updated dependencies.
- Use [`eslint-config-env`](https://npm.im/eslint-config-env) to simplify ESLint config.
- JSDoc annotated the source code.
- Compact package `repository` field.
- Readme badge changes to deal with [shields.io](https://shields.io) unreliability:
  - Used the more reliable build status badge provided by Travis and placed it first as it loads the quickest.
  - Removed the licence badge. The licence can be found in `package.json` and rarely changes.
  - Removed the Github issues and stars badges. The readme is most viewed on Github anyway.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release.
